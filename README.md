# Data Structure - Final Project
Graph Tool

```TODO: add actual shortest path rather than just length```

Take in a TGF file and analyze stuff. The format is:

```
# the pound sign is required, this is a comment, next are vertices
1 must start at 1
2 this is the vertex's name
3
4 description not mandatory

# blank lines are fine, now are edges
[origin] [destination] [weight (not mandatory)] [description]
2 3 1 I don't remember what happens when weight are not included for all edges
```

Good luck, have fun. Here's to the vacation in Disneyland Florida I could not enjoy because of this.

Shoutout to Andy, Jessie, Naomi. I was a retard. Still am.
